## AI Assistant Responses

### Before Enhancement
```
Q: "How do I improve my prompts?"
A: "That's a great question! Let me explain how prompt 
optimization works..."
(Generic, not helpful)
```

### After Enhancement
```
Q: "How do I improve my AI dev prompts?"
A: 
🚀 PROMPT OPTIMIZATION FOR AI DEVELOPMENT

To write better AI development prompts:

1. **Be Specific About Requirements**
   - Instead of: "Create a function"
   - Use: "Create a Python function that validates email 
     addresses using regex, handles edge cases, returns 
     boolean, and includes 3 test cases"

2. **Include Architecture Details**
   - Specify design patterns (MVC, Factory, Observer)
   - Define data structures needed
   - Explain relationships between components

3. **Add Context and Constraints**
   - Performance requirements
   - Security requirements
   - Integration requirements

4. **Request Code Examples**
   - Ask for working code snippets
   - Request error handling examples
   - Ask for configuration examples

5. **Specify Testing Needs**
   - Unit tests with frameworks
   - Edge case coverage
   - Performance benchmarks

[... more detailed guidance ...]

(Specific, detailed, mode-aware, actionable)
